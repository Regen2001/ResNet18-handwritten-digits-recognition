# ResNet18-handwritten-digits-recognition

A handwritten digit recognition neural network based on ResNet18 is validated using the MNIST dataset.

Due to the simplicity of the dataset, the number of convolutional kernels in each layer of the neural network is reduced in order to speed up the training.
